# Loan_Defaulters Prediction

<hr>

The Bank Indessa has not done well in the last 3 quarters. Their NPAs (Non Performing Assets) have reached all time high. It is starting to lose the confidence of its investors. As a result, itâ€™s stock has fallen by 20% in the previous quarter alone. After careful analysis, it was found that the majority of NPA was contributed by loan defaulters. 
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
